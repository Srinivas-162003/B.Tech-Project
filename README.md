# Secure Authentication System using Biometric Data

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design a machine learning-based secure authentication system using biometric data, behavioral biometrics, or multi-factor authentication techniques. This system aims to enhance security through advanced authentication methods.

## Techniques
The project utilizes various machine learning techniques, including:
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting key features from biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition, keystroke dynamics).
- **Classification**: Implementing models to classify and authenticate users based on extracted features.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used for image-based biometrics like facial recognition or fingerprint analysis.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Applied to behavioral biometrics, such as analyzing typing patterns or other temporal data.

## Tools
The following tools are used to implement the authentication system:
- **Python**: Primary programming language for developing the system.
- **TensorFlow**: Machine learning library used for building and training the neural networks.
- **OpenCV**: Library used for image processing tasks, particularly for image-based biometrics.
